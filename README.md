A command-line tool that allows you to interact with GPT-4 directly from your
terminal.

## Basic Usage

To use ShellGPT, simply run the command with your input message:

```sh
gpt "What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?"
# ... often humorously said to be the number 42 ...
```

You can also run shell commands with `-x`:

```sh
gpt -x "Undo my last git commit"
# git reset HEAD~1
# Are you SURE you wish to run the above command? (y/N): y

gpt -x "Download the wikipedia page for Capybaras with all images"
# wget -r -l 1 -H -t 1 -nd -N -np -A jpg,jpeg,gif,png -erobots=off https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara
```

And pipe input and output, transforming files and commands (pass `-` to accept
stdin):

```sh
cat mod.ts | gpt "Generate a helpful README file for this project" - > README.md

cat crash.log | gpt "Why is this crash occurring?" -

gpt "Output a CSV of 10 notable cities in Japan with their name in English & Japanese plus a fun fact enclosed in quotes" > japan.csv
```

## Installation

1. Install the
   [Deno runtime](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation).

2. Run the following command to install ShellGPT:

```sh
deno run -rA https://deno.land/x/shellgpt/install.ts
```

3. Ensure `$HOME/.deno/bin` is in your PATH.

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.deno/bin:$PATH"
```

After restarting your shell, that's it! You can now use `gpt [my request]` - or whatever you named the script during installation.

### Configuration

You must set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in your current shell,
using a key obtained from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys:

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

To use the GPT-4 model (recommended as it produces much better results), you'll
need to apply for access via [this link](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api).
Note that it is more expensive, however.

To configure the specific ChatGPT model, system prompt used, and more, you can type
`gpt --config`

## Features

Shell-GPT has some useful and unique features:

- Execute shell commands with a confirmation step (just pass `-x`).
- Supports input/output piping for simple file creation and transformation (see
  [Basic Usage](#basic-usage)).
- Utility commands for convenient chat history viewing and editing.
- Smooth, streaming output, resembling human typing rather than delayed or
  choppy responses.
- Built in Deno for better performance, granular permissions, and easier script
  modification.

## Examples

Continuing the conversation:

```sh
gpt "Give me 5 examples of auto-antonyms"
# Sanction, Bolt, Peruse, Trim, Overlook

gpt -c "Give 5 more"
# Cleave, Dust, Weather, Consult, Off
```

Regenerating the last assistant message:

```sh
gpt "Generate a tweet from the perspective of a cat"
# "Just spent 5 hours napping and now I can't decide if I should eat, stare out the window, or nap some more. #CatLife üêæüòΩüí§" ...

gpt -r
# Just knocked my hooman's coffee off the counter again... you'd think they'd learn by now nothing is safe at paw level üòπ #LivingLifeOnTheEdge #NineLives
```

Viewing and resuming past conversation history:

```sh
gpt --history
# shellgpt-demo-chat
# cat-tweets
# ...

gpt --name "cat-tweets" "Generate more, please"

gpt --dump # Dumps entire chat history
```

Setting a system prompt and custom temperature:

```sh
gpt --temp 0.85 --max 250 --sys "An AI personal trainer" "What exercises should I do for leg day?"
```

Increasing the speed of the output using GPT-3.5-turbo and custom WPM:

```sh
gpt --fast --wpm 1500 "How can I improve my programming skills?"
```

Interactive coding session:

```sh
gpt --code --repl "Write a typescript function that prints the first 100 primes"
```
